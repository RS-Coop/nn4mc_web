NOTES:

LeeLee:
  -The CSS won't load if you just open the html in your browser
  because of some server stuff I changed. You can fix this by adding a
  '..' in front of the '/static' in the href html stuff.

  -We need to figure out a loading screen dealio for when a user uploads
  files. Not sure if this is something you already know how to do, but here
  is at least one link: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_loader.asp

  -I added one function into the JS scripts file that isn't finished yet.
  That is how you will send the uploaded file to the server.

  -The process should be:
    --User uploads file
    --User clicks translate button
    --Loading screen initiated
    --JS calls post method sending file data
    --Python process data and returns new files
    --JS redirects to new page with files ready for download
    --Also potentially some visualization
    --User can download files or start over
